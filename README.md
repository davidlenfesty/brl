A poorly-designed resistive load.

I needed a resistive load to discharge some old LiPos for disposal, so I made this.
Designed with 90% parts on hand, so not exactly optimal or what I would want from a good
version.

Just adjust the pot to set a VREF and use an appropriately ranged shunt resistor to set your current.
